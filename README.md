Hi, my name is Patrick Villalpando III and for the last few years I have been working on my very own online multiplayer web game with potential to be on other platforms
I use mongodb for the database
Nodejs for the backend code running the game's server
Nginx for the web server
Socket.io for the communication between the backend and the frontend
Phaser 3 for the game framework

The backend code will always be closed source
I was stuck in endless nights of toiling on the web trying to figure out why my VPS was not working correctly at the very beginning
I will not throw that all away in the name of open source
I cherish my efforts

The frontend/client side code will be open source
This is a game built in javascript after all and as such you cannot fully protect client side code no matter your efforts
One way although would be to stream your game to the user but I have decided that I will be okay if my client side code is visible
After all, future employers can view my client side code to get a better understanding of my capabilities 

I will never take any sort of help from anyone with regard to any aspect of my game
Please do not annoy me by offering to help
You should instead go and make your own game and see how far you can get
While the client side code will be open source, I will not accept any sort of contributions

Why would I spend multiple years to get my game to the point it is at now only for someone to just come in and try to contribute?
I'm not a fool that gives in to these "internet people" who just love to get their greasy hands in other peoples hard work
